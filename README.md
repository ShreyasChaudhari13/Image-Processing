# Image-Processing

Description of image:

This code uses the Transformers library to perform image captioning with the "nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning" model:
1. It loads the pre-trained model, image processor, and tokenizer.
2. Determines whether to use a GPU or CPU for computation.
3. Defines caption generation parameters.
4. Provides a function, `predict_step`, to generate captions for a list of input images.
5. In the `predict_step` function, it processes the images, generates captions using the model, and returns the captions as a list.




Segmentation of Image:

This code performs instance segmentation on an image:
1. Clones the YOLOv7 repository, installs dependencies, and downloads a YOLOv7 model checkpoint.
2. Uses YOLOv7 to detect objects and perform segmentation on an input image.
3. Loads an image and initializes the MaskFormer model and image processor for segmentation.
4. Performs instance segmentation on the image using MaskFormer and visualizes the results, including segment labels and boundaries.
